# Model Compiler #
The [OPC Foundation](https://opcfoundation.org) Model Compiler will generate C# and ANSI C source code from XML files which include the UA Services, data-types, error codes, etc.; and numerous CSV files that contain NodeIds, error codes, and attributes etc.

The input format for the tool is a file that conforms to the schema defined in UA Model Design.xsd. 

The output of the tool includes:
 1. A NodeSet which conforms to the schema defined in Part 6 Annex F;
 2. An XSD and BSD (defined in Part 3 Annex C)  that describes any datatypes;
 3. Class and constant definitions suitable for use with the .NET sample libraries;
 4. Other data files used to load an information model into a Server built with the .NET sample libraries;
 5. A CSV file which contains numeric identifiers. 

The [UA Model Design.xsd](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-ModelCompiler/blob/master/Opc.Ua.ModelCompiler/UA%20Model%20Design.xsd) has more information about the schema itself.

The .NET sample libraries has [a sample Model Design file](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NET/blob/master/SampleApplications/Samples/Common/Sample/SampleDesign.xml) that illustrate how to create a user defined model.
This [batch file](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NET/blob/master/SampleApplications/Samples/Common/BuildDesign.bat) is used to regenerate the files used in the sample after changes.

The tool only produces ANSI C output for the stack.

All of the standard outputs are published in the [Nodeset GitHub repository](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-Nodeset)

Developers should never need to build the standard outputs themselves.

## Version History ##

|Version|Changes|
|--|--|
|2.0|Intial release with version tracking and .NET 5.0 support.|
|2.1|Added UA 1.05.00 support.<br/>Switched to Microsoft.Extensions.CommandLineUtils.<br/>Arguments are the same, however, the command 'compile' must be specified.<br/>Use --help for more details.<br/>Fixed bug in generating the 'uanodes' input for the .NET codebase.|

The executable file version has the form 2.0.YYMM.DDHH where the last two fields are based on the time that it was built.

## About this Repository ##
This repository contains *sub-modules*, which are independently tracked. Please clone this repository as shown:
```
git clone https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-ModelCompiler --recursive
```

This repository is not updated directly. All changes are first made in a member-only version that can be found [here](https://github.com/OPCF-Members/UA-ModelCompiler).

The version in the member-only repository includes content that is only available to OPC Foundation members such as draft versions of the specifications. When a new version of the OPC UA specification is released, the member-only content is removed and copied to the public repository. 

In many cases, updates to the UA-ModelCompiler will require updates to [UA-.NETStandard](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard) codebase. This means a complete release of the UA-ModelCompiler will need to wait for a update to UA-.NETStandard NuGet packages. The member only version links to a member only fork of [UA-.NETStandard](https://github.com/OPCF-Members/UA-.NETStandard-Prototypes) allows the changes to be viewed before they are merged with the public baseline.

The public repository is updated as frequently as the OPC UA Specification (once every 3-5 months). When a release starts, all issues reported on the public repository will be reviewed and, if appropricate, incorporated into the member-only codebase. This includes any pull requests to this public repository, which are subject to the [OPC Foundation Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/OPCFoundation/UA-ModelCompiler). When the process completes all accepted public contributions will be merged back into the public codebase along with updates from the member-only codebase.

## License Model ##

The ModelCompiler code is [MIT license](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-ModelCompiler/blob/master/license.md), however, it links to the UA-.NETStandard NuGet packages which is covered under the [OPC Foundation Redistributables licence](https://opcfoundation.org/license/redistributables/1.3/index.html). If a user chooses the version that links directly to the  UA-.NETStandard submodule then the license the UA-.NETStandard [dual license](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) applies. 
  
## Docker Build

The compiled version of this model compiler is available in GitHub Packages as [ghcr.io/opcfoundation/ua-modelcompiler](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-ModelCompiler/pkgs/container/uamodelcompiler).

If you like to build your own container, just use the provided Dockerfile and dockerbuild script in this repo.

###Usage 

Assume the model `myModel.xml` and `myModel.csv` are on the host system in `$HOME/myModel`. If not change the path in the next command.

The Docker container uses the model compiler executable as entry point.
This means that any parameter passed to the `docker run` command will be directly passed to the model compiler executable.

This is an exemplary call to docker run:

```bash
docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source=$HOME/myModel,target=/model \
  ghcr.io/opcfoundation/uamodelcompiler -- \
   -console compile -d2 /model/myModel.xml -cg /model/myModel.csv -o2 /model/Published/my_model
```

Note the binding `$HOME/myModel` to the path `/model` inside the container.

Ensure that the output directory already exists before running this command.

The expected output is:
```
Trying file: /model/OpcUaDiModel.xml
Trying file: ./Design/OpcUaDiModel.xml
Trying file: /model/OpcUaDiModel.csv
Trying file: ./Design/OpcUaDiModel.csv
```

Note, there's no final success message.


To use the `PublishModel.sh` script you can also override the entrypoint. The PublishModel script is a wrapper around the model compiler executable and is handling directory creation and copying the original model files.

```bash
docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source=$HOME/myModel,target=/model \
  --entrypoint "/app/PublishModel.sh" \
  ghcr.io/opcfoundation/uamodelcompiler \
   /model/myModel my_model /model/Published
```

The expected output is:
```
Building Model for 'my_model'
/app/Opc.Ua.ModelCompiler.exe -console -d2 /model/myModel.xml -cg /model/myModel.csv -o2 /model/Published/my_model
Trying file: /model/OpcUaDiModel.xml
Trying file: ./Design/OpcUaDiModel.xml
Trying file: /model/OpcUaDiModel.csv
Trying file: ./Design/OpcUaDiModel.csv
Copying Model files to /model/Published/my_model

```

## Example Generation ##
The following process will demonstrate how to generate code using the supplied nodeset files:
 1. Clone the repository and then build the source in Visual Studio 2019, in Release mode.
 2. Open a Command prompt and then launch the BuildStandardTypes.bat
 3. After the script completes, navigate to the .\Published folder to view the output.
 4. Optionally, modify the BAT file and specify the location of your UA Stack(s) to automatically copy the generated files.
